									Forward-thinking student in Computer science seeking to join an innovative and creative team to work hand in hand on bringing new solutions and pushing boundaries. Curious about all the technologies surrounding us. And especially the ones in the early stages of development that are trying to make breakthroughs. Also has an interest in space, and would like in the future to work for spacex or nasa or any other company in this field, thus currently working on my physics and math abilities. Have multiple hobbies outside of academic work: chess, tennis, skiing, swimming.

									Got introduced to the basics of python 6 years ago in high school in my computer classes, then a year later learned web devellopement from freecodeacademy.com and mastered html and css including a bit of javascript and built my first website. Then next summer read a book titled "Systèmes numériques concepts et applications" by Thomas L. Floyd where I discovered how electronics worked and got a lot of understanding of what is happening under the hood of the modern technologies that are being used everyday today. Then two years later I enrolled in a college computer science degree and joined Asher Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (ACIE) student community. Currently still enrolled and trying to contribute to open source projects regularly and stay up to date with the rapidly moving industry.
